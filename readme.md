## MedianFilter

Applying median filter on scans read from a file

### Description

This sample may currently be outdated.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. In order to edit the UI, you can either use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 or recreate it within the current version of SICK AppStudio by using the ScanView element from the extended control library (available for download).

This sample shows how to apply a median filter to scans read
from file and displays the filtered scan as a point cloud. A file scan provider
is created and and the scans from the file are played back. The filtered scan is
shown in the PointCloud viewer on the web-page
